Approach 1:
This snippet calls loops through each iteration of doubleL(n) and prints the results.
The function double n creates an empty list called res and for each number in the range 0 to
n, the number i is multiplied by 2 and added to the list res.

Approach 2:
This snippet iterates through a list of numbers that are multiplied by 2 within the 
range (5 in this case). For each iteration, the result is printed with an end parameter
' : '.

Approach 3:
This snippet contains a function that takes a number (n). The function
has a for loop which iterates for each value within the range 0-n. The function
then yields the iteration and sends the result of i*2 back to the caller which is 
a for loop that prints the value of each iteration of doubleG.


2.
doubleG(n) is a generator function. The advantages of this function are
that the values generated are sent to the caller rather than being saved
and returned. In this case, the result of i*2 is yielded, pausing the loop in 
the function and sending the value back to the caller which prints the value. After
this, doubleG continues its loop and repeats until condition is met.
